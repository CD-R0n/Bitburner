Websocket Server for the game Bitburner
=======================================

This is still very much a experimental work-in-progress for leisure and educational purposes.

I have a dedicated Linux laptop for playing this game.  
As you progress in the game, script you write become more and more advanced, to the point that using a dedicated coding editor becomes advantageous.  

I am creating a websocket server in combination with a Linux-Windows network setup so I can interface with the game from my main computer.

Bitburner is a programming-based [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)
that revolves around hacking and cyberpunk themes.
The game can be played at https://bitburner-official.github.io/ (release build), https://bitburner-official.github.io/bitburner-src/ (development build), or installed through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/).
